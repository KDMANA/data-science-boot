# Control Structures - If, Elif, Else, and the Boolean Data Type

## Overview ðŸ“š

This section represents my learning journey within the bootcamp, specifically focusing on control structures like `if`, `elif`, `else`, and exploring the Boolean data type. The file included below, `age-quiz.py`, showcases my practical application of these fundamental concepts.

## File ðŸ“‚

1. [age-quiz.py](age-quiz.py): Step into the world of control structures with this interactive age quiz. This file captures my progress in utilizing conditional statements and Boolean logic to provide tailored responses based on the user's age.

## My Learning Highlights ðŸŒŸ

Feel free to explore the `age-quiz.py` file to see how I've implemented control structures in a real-world scenario. This marks a significant step in my understanding of decision-making processes within programming.

Stay tuned for more updates on my coding journey! ðŸš€
