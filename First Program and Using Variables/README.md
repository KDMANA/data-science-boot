# My First Computer Program and Using Variables

## Overview :memo:

Welcome to the initial stage of my coding journey! This folder captures my early progress during the bootcamp, highlighting the creation of my first computer programs and the exploration of essential programming concepts like variables.

## Files :page_with_curl:

1. **`unique_hello_world.py`**: Dive into the basics with the classic "Hello, World!" program. This file represents my initial steps in writing and executing Python code.

2. **`details_user_input.py`**: Explore user interaction in programming. Learn how to handle user input, creating a more dynamic and engaging coding experience.

3. **`conversion_casting.py`**: Delve into the world of variable conversion using casting. Understand how to transform data types, an essential skill as I advance in my programming skills.

## How to Explore

Feel free to navigate through the files in the order listed above. Each file showcases a different aspect of my learning journey, from the simplicity of printing a greeting to user interaction and data type manipulation. This folder is a testament to my early efforts and progress in the bootcamp.

I'm excited to continue sharing my coding adventure with you! :wink:
